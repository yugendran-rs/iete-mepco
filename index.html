                    <p>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful village near Madurai. The president of the village planned to take census to
                    know the population rate of the village. He ordered to take census. The census work was started. Men and women were
                    allocated to take census in area wise. One day, Hero went to a home. Knocked the door!!</p>
                    <p>An old man came and asked that what he wanted. The Hero said, I am here to take census and kindly asked that how many
                    people are staying in your house and what was their age?</p>
                    <p>The old man replied to the Hero that his home consists of 100 members. The Hero stunned and asked how? The old man said,
                    we are living as a joint family and are staying in this home since 7 generations. Then he exclaimed, Oh! Is your family
                    members always marry within your family member and you are living as a joint family? The old man said, No, Not like
                    that. In our family we allow all type of members to stay here and our family members married with other caste and
                    religion people also. We have all religion & caste people in our home and they may follow their own culture in this
                    home. The Hero was very surprised about that and then he take took the census and felt happy about that.</p>

                    <p>Alarm was ringing, Akshay woke up after snoozing it number of times. It was a fine summer morning and a weekend. Without
                    any hurry he took his mobile and started to look into the notifications that was showing up. One such notification
                    caught his attention which reminded him of a tour with his friends. Those memories started to took over Akshay which
                    made him to decide to go on for a vacation with all his 20 buddies. Akshay took his phone, sent a message in the group
                    saying that they should go on for this beautiful trip to Coorg. Everyone was initially excited with this idea and all
                    agreed to join in. But as time goes on, few pgjjeople backed away from joining saying stupid reasons</p>
                    <p>As Askhay initiated all this, obviously he has to take care of all the responsibility, starting from day 1 of trip. To
                    make the trip even more memorable he wanted to go by train. In the website, he decided on two trains and was confused to
                    finalize one among them. One train takes relatively short duration for their journey but with only around 25 vacancies.
                    While the other one takes a rather long time for the travel but only one third of the seats were booked. Akshay wanted
                    their travel time to be short on the other hand, he knows his friends very well, that they might want to join at the
                    last moment. So he preferred the other train in which there is zero possibility of not getting seats at the last moment.</p>
